## Trigraphs
Trigraphs were removed in C++17 and will not be supported in SoupSyntax.

## Alternative Operator Tokens
To support writing C++ source code in any non-ASCII 7-bit character sets there are alternatives to those characters outside the ISO 646 codeset "{ } [ ] # \ ^ | ~".

We do not support these alternatives and there is no plan to support them.
